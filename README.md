My name is Parm and I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Toronto. I plan to work towards the minors in Robotics and Bioengineering. I'm also a pretty big Linux and FOSS enthusiast who likes tinkering around with my computer. My distro of choice is [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) which I've been daily driving for about 5 years now and can give it big thumbs up 👍. I have made games using Godot and work on the arm team for UofT's [Robotics for Space Exploration ](https://rsx.squarespace.com/) (RSX) Team. Using Godot I worked with a [friend](https://github.com/LingLing40Hours) to make and submit games to two different game jams which you can check out on my [itch](https://battlemonk345.itch.io/) page. At RSX I'm the Arm Control Software Lead and have developed the arm inverse kinematics and vizualization ROS nodes with future plans to develop autnomous arm control.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Behavior Trees, Robot Path Planning, Simulation, and Ricing my Distro (I'll share my dots eventually)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ROS2, OpenCV, Vulkan, and Rust
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any Bioinformatics, Space Exploration, or Aerospace releated projects
